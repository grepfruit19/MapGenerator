# MapGenerator
This is a personal project I was inspired to take up after playing a bit of Dungeon World with some friends (a game similar to Dungeons and Dragons). I wanted to be able to randomly generate maps, because for whatever reason, I didn't really like that part of the game.  There are already resources like that around, but I just wanted to make my own. 

Currently it creates a very simple map, (water or land), and creates an image.

Future additions may include
- Elevation (Several heights of land and sea)
- Different terrain (desert, tundra, etc)
- City locations
- Borders
